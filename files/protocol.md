<h2 id="protocol">Protocol for usage of our Explanation Ontology</h2>
Below, we present a protocol that can be used as a guide to reuse our explanation ontology in a sketched-out use case.

<h3>The protocol</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Gathering requirements</b>
<ol>
   <li>Conduct a user study to gather the user's <b>requirements</b> of the system</li>
    <li>Identify and list <b>user questions</b> to be addressed</li>
    <!--% \item Query our explanation ontology using Q2 of our competency questions, to see examples of questions addressed by explanation types we support-->
</ol></li>
 <li><b>Modeling</b>
    <ol>
       <li>Align <b>user questions</b> to explanation types</li>
    <li>Finalize <b>explanations</b> to be included in the system</li>
   <li>Identify <b>components</b> to be filled in for each explanation type</li>
    <li>Plan to populate <b>slots for each explanation type</b> desired</li>
       <li>Use the <b>structure of sufficiency conditions</b> to encode the desired set of explanations</li>
    </ol></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="resources">Resource to supplement protocol</h3>
This protocol can be further understood, by browsing the resources we have made available:
   <ul>
   <li>Components of each explanation type can be queried by competency question <a href="{{site.baseurl}}files/competencyquestions/#question2">#2</a></li>
   </ul>
