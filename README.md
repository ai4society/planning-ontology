# A Planning Ontology to Represent and Exploit Planning Knowledge for Performance Efficiency

This repository hosts the website and code for the ICAPS'23 paper _Building and Using a Planning Ontology From Past Data for Performance Efficiency_.

- The code, consisting of the data, experimentation, documentation, scripts, etc., for the paper can be found in the [`AI-Planning-Ontology`](https://github.com/ai4society/planning-ontology/tree/main/AI-Planning-Ontology) folder.


- The website detailing the paper can be found at the following address: [https://ai4society.github.io/planning-ontology/](https://ai4society.github.io/planning-ontology/). 
- The website takes inspiration and layout from [Explanation Ontology Resource website](https://github.com/tetherless-world/explanation-ontology) and the [Hyde theme](https://hyde.getpoole.com/).

## Planning Ontology Tool

The Planning Ontology is available as an interactive tool on the [Planning.Domains](https://editor.planning.domains) website. This tool transforms PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) domain and problem files, along with generated plan files, into RDF/OWL knowledge graphs. It provides visualization capabilities using D3.js and enables SPARQL querying, making it easier to explore and analyze planning knowledge.

**Key Features:**
- Transforms PDDL files into RDF/OWL knowledge graphs
- Interactive visualization of planning domains and problems
- SPARQL query interface for semantic exploration
- Direct integration with the Planning.Domains online PDDL editor
